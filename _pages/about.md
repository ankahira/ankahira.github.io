Hi, I am Albert, a Computer Science Researcher and Educator.

I was born in Mpeketoni, a small town in what is today called Lamu County. I grew up in Mombasa where I also attended high school. After High School, I got a scholarship to pursue Computer Engineering in Turkey. I would end up 7 years in Turkey before moving to Spain for my PhD.

I am a Research Scientist at Julich JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) working on the OPTIMA project and involved in several other EU projects. Prior to JSC, I was a researcher at Barcelona Supercomputing Center where I did my PhD in Computer Architectures at The Polytechnic University of Catalonia. My research focuses on Machine Learning in HPC systems. I am also an instructor at JENGA School where I teach Data Science and Programming.

Besides research, I am passionate about education and startups, especially those that revolve around AI and Education. I am the co-founder of Vendani School, a model school in Mombasa on a mission to raise the next generation of thoughtful and bright global leaders in different industries. I am also interested in poverty eradication, especially food prices/shortage in Africa.
